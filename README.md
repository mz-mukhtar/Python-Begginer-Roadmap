# 🐍 Python Beginner Roadmap

Welcome to the **Python Beginner Roadmap** — a practical and project-based curriculum designed to take **absolute beginners** to an **intermediate level in Python** in just **6 weeks**.

This roadmap is ideal for:
- High school students
- Self-taught learners
- Bootcamp participants
- Anyone looking for a structured path to learn Python fast

With **two 4-hour sessions per week**, learners will build real-world projects while mastering Python fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 🧠 Why Learn Python?

Python is one of the most popular, beginner-friendly, and versatile programming languages in the world. It powers everything from simple scripts to advanced artificial intelligence and web applications.

---

## 📜 A Brief History of Python

Python was created in the late 1980s by **Guido van Rossum** and released in 1991. It was designed to emphasize **code readability**, **simplicity**, and **productivity**. The name Python was inspired by the British comedy series **Monty Python’s Flying Circus**, not the snake!

Python's popularity skyrocketed due to:
- Clean, readable syntax
- Massive community support
- Versatile libraries (for AI, web dev, data science, etc.)
- Use in major companies like Google, Netflix, and NASA
