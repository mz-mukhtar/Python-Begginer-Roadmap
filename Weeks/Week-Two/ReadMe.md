# 📘 Week 2 Overview: Loops and Lists

In Week 2, you’ll explore **repetition and data collection** in Python. You’ll learn how to repeat tasks using loops and store multiple values using lists. These tools are essential for building scalable, reusable programs.

---

## 🔁 Session 1: Loops (for & while)

### ✅ Key Concepts:
- `while` loops for repeating tasks until a condition is false
- `for` loops using `range()`
- Loop control with `break` and `continue`
- Real-world examples like countdowns and number sequences

### 🛠️ Mini Project:
- **Login System with Retry Loop**: Allows 3 login attempts using `while`

---

## 🧺 Session 2: Lists and Data Handling

### ✅ Key Concepts:
- Creating and accessing Python lists
- Looping through lists using `for` and `while`
- Adding (`append()`), removing (`remove()`, `pop()`) items
- Finding list length and checking for membership

### 🚀 Mini Project:
- **Student Collector App**: Asks how many students to enter, stores names in a list, and displays the full list

---

By the end of Week 2, you will be able to:
- Repeat and automate tasks using loops
- Store and manipulate groups of values using lists
- Build interactive programs like login systems and data collectors

👉 Ready for [Week 3 →](../week3/README.md)? We’ll dive into **functions** and how to write reusable, organized code!
